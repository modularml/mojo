On this page, we'll show you how to create the classic "Hello world" starter
program with Mojo. If you'd rather read how to write Mojo code, see the
[introduction to Mojo](/mojo/manual/basics).

By installing Mojo, you understand and agree to our [software
license](https://www.modular.com/legal/max).

## 1. Create a new project

To create a new Mojo project, we'll use [Magic](/magic)â€”a virtual environment
manager and package manager based on conda.

1. Install Magic on macOS or Ubuntu Linux with this command:

    <MaxInstall type="magic" />

    Then run the `source` command printed in your terminal.

2. Create a Mojo project called "hello-world":

    ```sh
    magic init hello-world --format mojo
    ```

    This creates a directory named `hello-world` and installs the Mojo project
    dependenciesâ€”the only dependency for a Mojo project is the `max` package
    (Mojo is [bundled with MAX](/max/faq#why-bundle-mojo-with-max)).

3. Start a shell in the project virtual environment:

    ```sh
    cd hello-world && magic shell
    ```

That's it! The `magic shell` command activates the virtual environment so you
can now start using Mojo. For example, you can check your Mojo version like
this:

```sh
mojo --version
```


<details>
  <summary>Click here to install the Mojo nightly build.</summary>
  <div>

To install the latest nightly build, specify the `max-nightly` channel when you
initialize your project:

```sh
magic init hello-world-nightly --format mojo \
  -c conda-forge -c https://conda.modular.com/max-nightly
```

When you include the `-c` (`--channel`) option, you must specify all channels.
Be sure to specify the `conda-forge` channel (or another conda channel) where
Magic should look for all packages other than MAX/Mojo.

Then start a shell in the new environment:

```sh
cd hello-world-nightly && magic shell
```

The nightly version of Mojo installed in this project is fully independent, so
it will not interfere with other projects that use the latest stable build.

## 2. Run code in the REPL

First, let's use the Mojo
[REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop),
which allows you to write and run Mojo code in a command prompt:

1. To start a REPL session, type `mojo` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

2. Type `print("Hello, world!")` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice
(a blank line is required to indicate the end of an expression).

    The result looks like this:

    ```text
    $ mojo
    Welcome to Mojo! ðŸ”¥

    Expressions are delimited by a blank line.
    Type `:quit` to exit the REPL and `:mojo help repl` for further assistance.

      1> print("Hello world")
    Hello world
    ```

3. To exit REPL, type `:quit` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, or press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>.

You can write as much code as you want in the REPL. You can press
<kbd>Enter</kbd> to start a new line and continue writing code, and when you
want Mojo to evaluate the code, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice. If there's
something to print, Mojo prints it and then returns the prompt to you.

The REPL is primarily useful for short experiments because the code isn't
saved. So when you want to write a real program, you need to write the code in
a `.mojo` source file.

## 3. Run a Mojo file

Now let's write the code in a Mojo source file and run it with the
[`mojo`](/mojo/cli/) command:

1. Create a file named `hello.mojo` (or `hello.ðŸ”¥`) and add the following code:

   ```mojo
   fn main():
       print("Hello, world!")
   ```

   That's all you need. Save the file and return to your terminal.

2. Now run it with the `mojo` command:

    ```sh
    mojo hello.mojo
    ```

    ```output
    Hello, world!
    ```

## 4. Build an executable binary

Finally, let's build and run that same code as an executable:

1. Create an executable file with the [`build`](/mojo/cli/build) command:

    ```sh
    mojo build hello.mojo
    ```

    The executable file uses the same name as the `.mojo` file, but
    you can change that with the `-o` option.

2. Then run the executable:

    ```sh
    ./hello
    ```

    ```output
    Hello, world!
    ```

The [`build`](/mojo/cli/build) command creates a statically compiled binary
file, so it contains all the code and libraries it needs to run.

You can now deactivate the virtual environment by just typing `exit`:

```sh
exit
```

Now let's try running an existing code example.

## 5. Run an example from GitHub

Our Mojo code examples in GitHub include a Magic configuration file so you can
simply clone the repo and run the code with `magic`. For example:

1. Clone the Mojo repo:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/modularml/mojo.git
    ```

    Only if you installed the nightly build, also checkout the nightly branch:

    ```sh
    git checkout nightly
    ```

2. Navigate to the examples:

    ```sh
    cd mojo/examples
    ```

3. Run some code:

    ```sh
    magic run mojo hello_interop.mojo
    ```

    ```output
    Hello Mojo ðŸ”¥!
    9
    6
    3
    Hello from Python!
    I can even print a numpy array:  [1 2 3]
    ```

## 6. Install our VS Code extension (optional)

To provide a first-class developer experience with features like code
completion, quick fixes, and hover help, we've created a [Mojo extension for
Visual Studio
Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modular-mojotools.vscode-mojo).

## Update Mojo

To update the Mojo version in your project, use `magic add`
and specify the `max` package version.

For example, if you want to always use the latest version of Mojo, you can use
the `*` wildcard as the version and then simply run `magic update` (you must
run `magic add` within the project path):

```sh
cd hello-world
```

```sh
magic add "max=*"
```

```sh
magic update
```

:::note

Although the wildcard option allows `magic update` to always install the latest
version, it also updates the `magic.lock` file in your project with the
explicit version you've installed. This ensures that anybody else who
initializes the project also gets the same package version (until you run
`magic update` again).

:::

To be more specific with your package version, you can use any of the [Python
package version
specifiers](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#id5).
For example:

```sh
magic add "max~=24.4"
```

```sh
magic add "max>=24.4,<24.5"
```


## Next steps

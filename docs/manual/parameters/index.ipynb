Python has facilities for dynamic metaprogramming: features like decorators, metaclasses, and many more. These features make Python very flexible and productive, but since they're dynamic, they come with runtime overhead. Other languages have static or compile-time metaprogramming features, like C preprocessor macros and C++ templates. These can be limiting and hard to use.\n",

This usage of \"parameter\" is probably different from what you're used to from other languages, where \"parameter\" and \"argument\" are often used interchangeably.

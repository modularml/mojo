    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Mojo doesn't yet support top-level code, so the `import_module()` call must\n",
    "  be inside another method. This means you may need to import a module multiple\n",
    "  times or pass around a reference to the module. This works the same way as \n",
    "  Python: importing the module multiple times won't run the initialization\n",
    "  logic more than once, so you don't pay any performance penalty.\n",
    "\n",

    "  handle errors (using a `try/except` clause), or add the `raises` keyword to\n",
    "  the function signature. You'll also see this when calling Python functions\n",

    "This may present a challenge for using certain modules. For example, many UI \n",

    "pattern. Instead of your application code calling *in* to a library, the \n",
    "framework code calls *out* to your application code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern doesn't work because you can't pass Mojo callbacks to a Python \n",
    "module.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the popular [Tkinter package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html). \n",
    "The typical usage for Tkinter is something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You create a main, or \"root\" window for the application.\n",
    "- You add one or more UI widgets to the window. The widgets can have associated\n",
    "  callback functions (for example, when a button is pushed).\n",
    "- You call the root window's `mainloop()` method, which listens for events, \n",
    "  updates the UI, and invokes callback functions. The main loop keeps running\n",
    "  until the application exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python can't call back into Mojo, one alternative is to have the Mojo\n",
    "application drive the event loop and poll for updates. The following example\n",
    "uses Tkinter, but the basic approach can be applied to other packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you create a Python module that defines a Tkinter interface, with a window\n",

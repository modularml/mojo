# Code of conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

## Our standards

All community forums and spaces are meant for professional interactions that
are friendly, inclusive, helpful, and collaborative. Examples of behavior that
contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Any behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
professional setting is unacceptable. Examples of unacceptable behavior by
participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission.
- Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate for the forum in
  which it occurs.

## Our responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project content and public spaces on the
Mojo GitHub repo, the rest of Modular’s GitHub organization, and all other
official Mojo community spaces and communication mediums, whether offline or
online.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassment, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be
reported to the project team at <mojo+conduct@modular.com>. All complaints will
be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated
to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further
details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4,
available at <https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4>, and includes some
aspects of the Geek Feminism Code of Conduct and the Drupal Code of Conduct.

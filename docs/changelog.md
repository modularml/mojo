### ⭐️ New

- Mojo now diagnoses "argument exclusivity" violations due to aliasing
  references.  Mojo requires references (including implicit references due to
  borrowed/inout arguments) to be uniquely referenced (non-aliased) if mutable.
  This is important for code safety, because it allows the compiler (and readers
  of code) to understand where and when a value is mutated.  It is also useful
  for performance optimization because it allows the compiler to know that
  accesses through immutable references cannot change behind the scenes. Here is
  an invalid example:

  ```mojo
  fn take_two_strings(a: String, inout b: String):
     # Mojo knows 'a' and 'b' cannot be the same string.
     b += a

  fn invalid_access():
    var my_string = String()

    # error: passing `my_string` inout is invalid since it is also passed
    # borrowed.
    take_two_strings(my_string, my_string)
  ```

  This is similar to [Swift exclusivity
  checking](https://swift.org/blog/swift-5-exclusivity/) and the [Rust
  language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html)
  sometimes known as "aliasing xor mutability". That said, the Mojo
  implementation details are somewhat different because lifetimes are embedded
  in types.

- Mojo now allows implicit definitions of variables within a `fn` in the same
  way that has been allowed in a `def`.  The `var` keyword is still allowed and
  still denotes the declaration of a new variable with a scope (in both `def`
  and `fn`).  Relaxing this makes `fn` and `def` more similar, but they still
  differ in other important ways.

- Mojo now supports named result bindings. Named result bindings are useful for
  directly emplacing function results into the output slot of a function. This
  feature provides more flexibility and guarantees around emplacing the result
  of a function compared to "guaranteed" NRVO. If a `@register_passable` result
  is bound to a name, the result value is made accessible as a mutable
  reference.

  ```mojo
  fn efficiently_return_string(b: Bool) -> String as output:
      if b:
          output = "emplaced!"
          mutate(output)
          return
      return "regular return"
  ```

  If we used a temporary for `output` instead, we would need to move into the
  result slot, which wouldn't work if the result type was non-movable.

  In a function with a named result, `return` may be used with no operand to
  signal an exit from the function, or it can be used normally to specify the
  return value of the function. The compiler will error if the result is not
  initialized on all normal exit paths from the function.

- `String` class now have `rjust`, `ljust` and `center` methods to return
  a justified string based on width and fillchar.
  ([PR 3278#](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3278) by
  [@mzaks](https://github.com/mzaks))

- Creating nested `PythonObject` from a list or tuple of python objects is
  possible now:

  ```mojo
  var np = Python.import_module("numpy")
  var a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
  var b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
  var arrays = PythonObject([a, b])
  assert_equal(len(arrays), 2)
  ```

  Also allowing more convenient call syntax:

  ```mojo
  var stacked = np.hstack((a, b))
  assert_equal(str(stacked), "[1 2 3 4 5 6]")
  ```

  ([PR 3264#](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3264) by
  [@kszucs](https://github.com/kszucs))

- `List[T]` values are now equality comparable with `==` and `!=` when `T` is
  equality comparable.
  ([PR 3195#](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3195) by
  [@kszucs](https://github.com/kszucs))

- `__setitem__` now works with variadic argument lists such as:

  ```mojo
  struct YourType:
      fn __setitem__(inout self, *indices: Int, val: Int): ...
  ```

  The Mojo compiler now always passes the "new value" being set using the last
  keyword argument of the `__setitem__`, e.g. turning `yourType[1, 2] = 3` into
  `yourType.__setitem__(1, 2, val=3)`.  This fixes
  [Issue #248](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/248).

- `Optional` values are now equality comparable with `==` and `!=` when their
  element type is equality comparable.

- Added a new [`Counter`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/counter/Counter)
  dictionary-like type, matching most of the features of the Python one.
  ([PR 2910#](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2910) by
  [@msaelices](https://github.com/msaelices))

- Mojo context managers used in regions of code that may raise no longer need to
  define a "conditional" exit function in the form of
  `fn __exit__(self, e: Error) -> Bool`. This function allows the context
  manager to conditionally intercept and handle the error and allow the function
  to continue executing. This is useful for some applications, but in many cases
  the conditional exit would delegate to the unconditional exit function
  `fn __exit__(self)`.

  Concretely, this enables defining `with` regions that unconditionally
  propagate inner errors, allowing code like:

  ```mojo
  def might_raise() -> Int:
      ...

  def foo() -> Int:
      with ContextMgr():
          return might_raise()
      # no longer complains about missing return

  def bar():
      var x: Int
      with ContextMgr():
          x = might_raise()
      print(x) # no longer complains about 'x' being uninitialized
  ```

- Now supports "conditional conformances" where some methods on a struct have
  additional trait requirements that the struct itself doesn't. This is
  expressed through an explicitly declared `self` type:

  ```mojo
  struct GenericThing[Type: AnyType]:  # Works with anything
    # Sugar for 'fn normal_method[Type: AnyType](self: GenericThing[Type]):'
    fn normal_method(self): ...

    # Just redeclare the requirements with more specific types:
    fn needs_move[Type: Movable](self: GenericThing[Type], owned val: Type):
      var tmp = val^  # Ok to move 'val' since it is Movable
      ...
  fn usage_example():
    var a = GenericThing[Int]()
    a.normal_method() # Ok, Int conforms to AnyType
    a.needs_move(42)  # Ok, Int is movable

    var b = GenericThing[NonMovable]()
    b.normal_method() # Ok, NonMovable conforms to AnyType

      # error: argument type 'NonMovable' does not conform to trait 'Movable'
    b.needs_move(NonMovable())
  ```

  Conditional conformance works with dunder methods and other things as well.

- `async` functions now support memory-only results (like `String`, `List`,
  etc.) and `raises`. Accordingly, both `Coroutine` and `RaisingCoroutine` have
  been changed to accept `AnyType` instead of `AnyTrivialRegType`. This means
  the result types of `async` functions do not need to be `Movable`.

  ```mojo
  async fn raise_or_string(c: Bool) raises -> String:
      if c:
          raise "whoops!"
      return "hello world!"
  ```

  Note that `async` functions do not yet support indirect calls, `ref` results,
  and constructors.

- As a specific form of "conditional conformances", initializers in a struct
  may indicate specific parameter bindings to use in the type of their `self`
  argument. For example:

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct MyStruct[size: Int]:
      fn __init__(inout self: MyStruct[0]): pass
      fn __init__(inout self: MyStruct[1], a: Int): pass
      fn __init__(inout self: MyStruct[2], a: Int, b: Int): pass

  def test(x: Int):
      a = MyStruct()      # Infers size=0 from 'self' type.
      b = MyStruct(x)     # Infers size=1 from 'self' type.
      c = MyStruct(x, x)  # Infers size=2 from 'self' type.
  ```

- The `Reference` type (and many iterators) now use
  [infer-only parameters](/mojo/manual/parameters/#infer-only-parameters) to
  represent the mutability of their lifetime, simplifying the interface.

- `Dict` now implements `setdefault`, to get a value from the dictionary by
  key, or set it to a default if it doesn't exist
  ([PR #2803](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2803)
  by [@msaelices](https://github.com/msaelices))

- Added new `ExplicitlyCopyable` trait, to mark types that can be copied
  explicitly, but which might not be implicitly copyable.

  This supports work to transition the standard library collection types away
  from implicit copyability, which can lead to unintended expensive copies.

- Added `Identifiable` trait, used to describe types that implement the `__is__`
  and `__isnot__` trait methods.
  ([PR #2807](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2807))

  - Also added new `assert_is()` and `assert_is_not()` test utilities to the
    `testing` module.

- `Dict` now supports `popitem`, which removes and returns the last item in the `Dict`.
  ([PR #2701](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2701)
  by [@jayzhan211](https://github.com/jayzhan211))

- Added `unsafe_cstr_ptr()` method to `String` and `StringLiteral`, that
  returns an `UnsafePointer[C_char]` for convenient interoperability with C
  APIs.

- Added `C_char` type alias in `sys.ffi`.

- Added `StringSlice(..)` initializer from a `StringLiteral`.

- Added a `byte_length()` method to `String`, `StringSlice`, and `StringLiteral`
and deprecated their private `_byte_length()` methods. Added a warning to
`String.__len__` method that it will return length in Unicode codepoints in the
future and `StringSlice.__len__` now does return the Unicode codepoints length.
([PR #2960](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2960) by [@martinvuyk](https://github.com/martinvuyk))

- Added new `StaticString` type alias. This can be used in place of
  `StringLiteral` for runtime string arguments.

- Added `TemporaryDirectory` in module `tempfile`.
  ([PR 2743](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2743) by [@artemiogr97](https://github.com/artemiogr97))

- Added `NamedTemporaryFile` in module `tempfile`.
  ([PR 2762](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2762) by [@artemiogr97](https://github.com/artemiogr97))

- Added `oct(..)` function for formatting an integer in octal.
  ([PR #2914](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2914) by [@bgreni](https://github.com/bgreni))

- Added `String.format` method.
  ([PR #2771](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2771) by [@rd4com](https://github.com/rd4com))

  Support automatic and manual indexing of `*args`.

  Examples:

  ```mojo
  print(
    String("{1} Welcome to {0} {1}").format("mojo", "🔥")
  )
  # 🔥 Wecome to mojo 🔥
  ```

  ```mojo
  print(String("{} {} {}").format(True, 1.125, 2))
  #True 1.125 2
  ```

- Added the builtin `input` function, which behaves the same as Python.
  ([PR #3392](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3392) by [@thatstoasty](https://github.com/thatstoasty))

  ```mojo
  name = input("Enter your name: ")
  print("Hello, " + name + "!")
  ```

  If the user enters "Mojo" it returns "Hello Mojo!"

- Environment variable `MOJO_PYTHON` can be pointed to an executable to pin Mojo
  to a specific version:

  ```sh
  export MOJO_PYTHON="/usr/bin/python3.11"
  ```

  Or a virtual environment to always have access to those Python modules:

  ```sh
  export MOJO_PYTHON="~/venv/bin/python"
  ```

  `MOJO_PYTHON_LIBRARY` still exists for environments with a dynamic libpython,
  but no Python executable.

- The `math` package now includes the `pi`, `e`, and `tau` constants (Closes
  Issue [#2135](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/2135)).

- Mojo now has a `UInt` type for modeling unsigned (scalar) integers with a
  paltform-dependent width. `UInt` implements most arithmetic operations that
  make sense for integers, with the notable exception of `__neg__`. Builtin
  functions such as `min`/`max`, as well as `math` functions like `ceildiv`,
  `align_down`, and `align_up` are also implemented for `UInt`.

- `os.path.expanduser()` and `pathlib.Path.exapanduser()` have been added to
  allow expanding a prefixed `~` in a `String` or `Path` with the users home
  path:

  ```mojo
  import os
  print(os.path.expanduser("~/.modular"))
  # /Users/username/.modular
  print(os.path.expanduser("~root/folder"))
  # /var/root/folder (on macos)
  # /root/folder     (on linux)
  ```

- `Path.home()` has been added to return a path of the users home directory.

- `os.path.split()` has been added for splitting a path into `head, tail`:

  ```mojo
  import os
  head, tail = os.path.split("/this/is/head/tail")
  print("head:", head)
  print("tail:", tail)
  # head: /this/is/head
  # tail: tail
  ```

- `os.path.makedirs()` and `os.path.removedirs()` have been added for creating
  and removing nested directories:

  ```mojo
  import os
  path = os.path.join("dir1", "dir2", "dir3")
  os.path.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True)
  os.path.removedirs(path)
  ```

- The `pwd` module has been added for accessing user information in
  `/etc/passwd` on POSIX systems. This follows the same logic as Python:

  ```mojo
  import pwd
  import os
  current_user = pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid())
  print(current_user)

  # pwd.struct_passwd(pw_name='jack', pw_passwd='********', pw_uid=501,
  # pw_gid=20, pw_gecos='Jack Clayton', pw_dir='/Users/jack',
  # pw_shell='/bin/zsh')

  print(current_user.pw_uid)

  # 501

  root = pwd.getpwnam("root")
  print(root)

  # pwd.struct_passwd(pw_name='root', pw_passwd='*', pw_uid=0, pw_gid=0,
  # pw_gecos='System Administrator', pw_dir='/var/root', pw_shell='/bin/zsh')
  ```

- Added `Dict.__init__` overload to specify initial capacity.
  ([PR #3171](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3171) by [@rd4com](https://github.com/rd4com))

  The capacity has to be a power of two and above or equal 8.

  It allows for faster initialization by skipping incremental growth steps.

  Example:

  ```mojo
  var dictionary = Dict[Int,Int](power_of_two_initial_capacity = 1024)
  # Insert (2/3 of 1024) entries
  ```

- `ListLiteral` now supports `__contains__`.
  ([PR #3251](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3251) by
  [@jjvraw](https://github.com/jjvraw))

- `bit` module now supports `bit_reverse()`, `byte_swap()` and `pop_count()` for
  `Int` type.
  ([PR #3150](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3150) by [@LJ-9801](https://github.com/LJ-9801))

- `String.format()` now supports conversion flags `!s` and `!r`, allowing for
  `str()` and `repr()` conversions within format strings.
  ([PR #3279](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3279) by [@jjvraw](https://github.com/jjvraw))

  Example:

  ```mojo
  String("{} {!r}").format("Mojo", "Mojo")
  # "Mojo 'Mojo'"

  String("{0!s} {0!r}").format("Mojo")
  # "Mojo 'Mojo'"
  ```

- `sort` now supports `stable` parameter. It can be called by

  ```mojo
  sort[cmp_fn, stable=True](list)
  ```

  The algorithm requires $$O(N)$$ auxiliary memory, if extra memory is failed to
  allocate, the program will crash.

- The `mojo test` command now accepts a `--filter` option that will narrow the
  set of tests collected and executed. The filter string is a POSIX extended
  regular expression.

- The `mojo test` command now supports using the same compilation options as
  `mojo build`.

- You can now debug unit tests using `mojo test` by passing the `--debug` flag.
  Most debug flags are supported; run `mojo test --help` for a full listing.

  Debugging doctests is not currently supported.

- `UnsafePointer` now has an `alignment` parameter to specify the static
  alignment of the pointer. Consequently, `UnsafePointer.alloc` no longer takes
  in an alignment parameter, and the alignment should be specified in the type.

  ```mojo
  UnsafePointer[type].alloc[alignment](x) # now becomes
  UnsafePointer[type, alignment].alloc(x)
  ```

### 🦋 Changed

- The set of automatically imported entities (types, aliases, functions) into user's
  Mojo programs has been dramatically reduced.  Before, with the way the `builtin`
  module was handled, all of the entities in the following modules would be automatically
  included:

  {'memory', 'sys', 'os', 'utils', 'python', 'bit', 'random', 'math',
   'builtin', 'collections'}

  Now, only the explicitly enumerated entities in `prelude/__init__.mojo` are
  the ones automatically imported into user's Mojo programs.  This will break
  a lot of user code as users will need to explicitly import what they're using
  for cases previously commonly included before (such as `Optional`, `Variant`,
  and so on).

- Some types from the `builtin` module have been moved to different modules for clarity
  which is made possible now that we have a `prelude` module that can re-export symbols
  from modules other than `builtin`.
  - `builtin.string` has been moved to `collections.string`.

- The pointer aliasing semantics of Mojo have changed. Initially, Mojo adopted a
  C-like set of semantics around pointer aliasing and derivation. However, the C
  semantics bring a lot of history and baggage that are not needed in Mojo and
  which complicate compiler optimizations. The language overall provides a
  stronger set of invariants around pointer aliasing with lifetimes and
  exclusive mutable references to values, etc.

  It is now forbidden to convert a non-pointer-typed value derived from a
  Mojo-allocated pointer, such as an integer address, to a pointer-typed value.
  "Derived" means there is overlap in the bits of the non-pointer-typed value
  with the original pointer value. Accordingly, the `UnsafePointer` constructor
  that took an `address` keyword argument has been removed.

  It is still possible to make this conversion in certain cases where it is
  absolutely necessary, such as interoperating with other languages like Python.
  In this case, the compiler makes two assumptions: any pointer derived from a
  non-pointer-typed value does not alias any Mojo-derived pointer and that any
  external function calls have arbitrary memory effects.

- `DTypePointer` , `LegacyPointer` and `Pointer` have been removed. Use
  [`UnsafePointer`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/unsafe_pointer/) instead. For more
  information on using pointers, see [Unsafe pointers](/mojo/manual/pointers) in
  the Mojo Manual.

  Functions that previously took a `DTypePointer` now take an
  equivalent `UnsafePointer`. A quick rule for conversion from `DTypePointer` to
  `UnsafePointer` is:

  ```mojo
  DTypePointer[type] -> UnsafePointer[Scalar[type]]
  ```

  There could be places that you have code of the form:

  ```mojo
  fn f(ptr: DTypePointer):
  ```

  which is equivalent to `DTypePointer[*_]`. In this case you would have to add
  an infer-only `type` parameter to the function:

  ```mojo
  fn f[type: DType, //](ptr: UnsafePointer[Scalar[type]]):
  ```

  because we can’t have an unbound parameter inside the struct.

  There could also be places where you use
  `DTypePointer[Scalar[DType.invalid/index]]`, and it would be natural to
  change these to `UnsafePointer[NoneType/Int]`. But since these are not an
  `UnsafePointer` that stores a `Scalar`, you might have to `rebind/bitcast` to
  appropriate types.

- The `DTypePointer` `load()`, `store()`, and `prefetch()` methods have been
  moved to `SIMD` and now take an
  `UnsafePointer` as an argument. Instead of using `ptr.load[width=4](offset)`
  one should use `SIMD[size=4].load(ptr, offset)`. Note the default load width
  before was 1, but the default size of `SIMD` is the size of the SIMD type. The
  default store size is the size of the `SIMD` value to be stored.

- `UnsafePointer` now supports `simd_strided_load()`, `simd_strided_store()`,
  `gather()`, and `scatter()` when the underlying type is `Scalar[DType]`.

- The global functions for working with `UnsafePointer` have transitioned to
  being methods through the use of conditional conformances:

  - `destroy_pointee(p)` => `p.destroy_pointee()`
  - `move_from_pointee(p)` => `p.take_pointee()`
  - `initialize_pointee_move(p, value)` => `p.init_pointee_move(value)`
  - `initialize_pointee_copy(p, value)` => `p.init_pointee_copy(value)`
  - `move_pointee(src=p1, dst=p2)` => `p.move_pointee_into(p2)`

- The `UnsafePointer.offset()` method has been removed. Use
  [pointer arithmetic](/mojo/manual/pointers#storing-multiple-values) instead.

  ```mojo
  new_ptr = ptr.offset(1)
  ```

  Becomes:

  ```mojo
  new_ptr = ptr + 1
  ```

- `UnsafePointer` has a new
  `exclusive: Bool = False` parameter. Setting this parameter to true tells the
  compiler that the user knows this pointer and all those derived from it have
  exclusive access to the underlying memory allocation. The compiler is not
  guaranteed to do anything with this information.

- It is no longer possible to cast (implicitly or explicitly) from `Reference`
  to `UnsafePointer`. Instead of `UnsafePointer(someRef)` please use the
  `UnsafePointer.address_of(someRef[])` which makes the code explicit that the
  `UnsafePointer` gets the address of what the reference points to.

- `sort` no longer takes `LegacyPointer`. The current API supports:
  - `sort(list)` just plain list
  - `sort[type, cmp_fn](list)` list with custom compare function
  - `sort(ptr, len)` a pointer and length (can change to Span in future)
  - `sort[type, cmp_fn](ptr, len)` above with custom compare

- Continued transition to `UnsafePointer` and unsigned byte type for strings:

  - `String.unsafe_ptr()` now returns an `UnsafePointer[UInt8]`
    (was `UnsafePointer[Int8]`)
  - `StringLiteral.unsafe_ptr()` now returns an `UnsafePointer[UInt8]`
    (was `UnsafePointer[Int8]`)

- `await` on a coroutine now consumes it. This strengthens the invariant that
  coroutines can only be awaited once.

- `print()` now requires that its arguments conform to the `Formattable` trait.
  This enables efficient stream-based writing by default, avoiding unnecessary
  intermediate String heap allocations.

  Previously, `print()` required types conform to `Stringable`. This meant that
  to execute a call like `print(a, b, c)`, at least three separate String heap
  allocations were down, to hold the formatted values of `a`, `b`, and `c`
  respectively. The total number of allocations could be much higher if, for
  example, `a.__str__()` was implemented to concatenate together the fields of
  `a`, like in the following example:

  ```mojo
  struct Point(Stringable):
      var x: Float64
      var y: Float64

      fn __str__(self) -> String:
          # Performs 3 allocations: 1 each for str(..) of each of the fields,
          # and then the final returned `String` allocation.
          return "(" + str(self.x) + ", " + str(self.y) + ")"
  ```

  A type like the one above can transition to additionally implementing
  `Formattable` with the following changes:

  ```mojo
  struct Point(Stringable, Formattable):
      var x: Float64
      var y: Float64

      fn __str__(self) -> String:
          return String.format_sequence(self)

      fn format_to(self, inout writer: Formatter):
          writer.write("(", self.x, ", ", self.y, ")")
  ```

  In the example above, `String.format_sequence(<arg>)` is used to construct a
  `String` from a type that implements `Formattable`. This pattern of
  implementing a type's `Stringable` implementation in terms of its `Formattable`
  implementation minimizes boilerplate and duplicated code, while retaining
  backwards compatibility with the requirements of the commonly used `str(..)`
  function.

  <!-- TODO(MOCO-891): Remove this warning when error is improved. -->

  > [!WARNING]
  > The error shown when passing a type that does not implement `Formattable` to
  > `print()` is currently not entirely descriptive of the underlying cause:
  >
  > ```shell
  > error: invalid call to 'print': callee with non-empty variadic pack argument expects 0 positional operands, but 1 was specified
  >    print(point)
  >    ~~~~~^~~~~~~
  > ```
  >
  > If the above error is seen, ensure that all argument types implement
  > `Formattable`.

- `debug_assert()` now also requires that its `message` argument conform to
  `Formattable`.

- The `StringRef` constructors from `DTypePointer.int8` have been changed to
  take a `UnsafePointer[C_char]`, reflecting their use for compatibility with
  C APIs.

- `Slice` now uses `OptionalReg[Int]` for `start` and `end` and implements
  a constructor which accepts optional values. `Slice._has_end()` has also been
  removed since a Slice with no end is now represented by an empty `Slice.end`
  option.
  ([PR #2495](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2495) by [@bgreni](https://github.com/bgreni))

  ```mojo
    var s = Slice(1, None, 2)
    print(s.start.value()) # must retrieve the value from the optional
  ```

- `NoneType` is now a normal standard library type, and not an alias for a raw
  MLIR type.

  Function signatures spelled as `fn(...) -> NoneType` should transition to
  being written as `fn(...) -> None`.

- Accessing local Python modules with `Python.add_to_path(".")` is no longer
  required, it now behaves the same as Python, you can access modules in the
  same folder as the target file:

  - `mojo run /tmp/main.mojo` can access `/tmp/mymodule.py`
  - `mojo build main.mojo -o ~/myexe && ~/myexe` can access `~/mymodule.py`

- The rank argument for `algorihtm.elementwise` is no longer required and is
  only inferred.

- The `ulp` function in `numerics` has been moved to the `math` module.

- The Mojo Language Server no longer sets `.` as a commit character for
  auto-completion.

- Types conforming to `Boolable` (i.e. those implementing `__bool__`) no longer
  implicitly convert to `Bool`. A new `ImplicitlyBoolable` trait is introduced
  for types where this behavior is desired.

- The `time.now()` function has been deprecated. Please use `time.perf_counter`
  or `time.perf_counter_ns` instead.

- A few bit functions have been renamed for clarity:
- `countl_zero` -> `count_leading_zeros`
- `countr_zero` -> `count_trailing_zeros`

- Now that we have a `UInt` type, use this to represent the return type of hash.
  In general, hashes should be an unsigned integer, and can also lead to improved
  performance in certain cases.

- The `atol` function now correctly supports leading underscores,
  (e.g.`atol("0x_ff", 0)`), when the appropriate base is specified or inferred
  (base 0). non-base-10 integer literals as per Python's [Integer Literals](\
  <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#integers>).
  ([PR #3180](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3180)
  by [@jjvraw](https://github.com/jjvraw))

- `SIMD` construction from `Bool` has been restricted to `DType.bool` data type.

- `SIMD.load/store` are moved to `UnsafePointer`.

- `bitcast, sizeof, simdwidthof, bitwidthof, alignof, external_call` and `abort`
  are removed from prelude.

- The `simd_strided_load()` and `simd_strided_store()` have been renamed to
  `strided_load` and `strided_store` in `UnsafePointer`.

- `mojo test` now uses the Mojo compiler for running unit tests. This will resolve
  compilation issues that sometimes appeared, and will also improve overall test
  times, since we will only compile unit tests once before executing all of them.

  These changes do not apply to doctests, due to their different semantics.

### ❌ Removed

- Support for the legacy `fn __init__(...) -> Self:` form has been removed from
  the compiler, please switch to using `fn __init__(inout self, ...):` instead.

- Removed `String.unsafe_uint8_ptr()`. `String.unsafe_ptr()` now returns the
  same thing.

- Removed `StringLiteral.unsafe_uint8_ptr()` and `StringLiteral.as_uint8_ptr()`.

- Removed `SIMD.splat(value: Scalar[type])`. Use the constructor for SIMD
  instead.

- The builtin `tensor` module has been removed. Identical functionality is
  available in `max.tensor`, but it is generally recommended to use `buffer`
  when possible instead.

- Removed the Mojo Language Server warnings for unused function arguments.

- Removed the `SIMD.{add,mul,sub}_with_overflow` methods.

- Removed the `SIMD.min` and `SIMD.max` methods. Identical functionality is
  available using the builting `min` and `max` functions.

### 🛠️ Fixed

- Fixed a crash in the Mojo Language Server when importing the current file.

- Fixed crash when specifying variadic keyword arguments without a type
  expression in `def` functions, e.g.:

  ```mojo
  def foo(**kwargs): ...  # now works
  ```

- Mojo now prints `ref` arguments and results in generated documentation
  correctly.

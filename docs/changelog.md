## UNRELEASED

### ⭐️ New

- `async` functions now support memory-only results (like `String`, `List`,
  etc.) and `raises`. Accordingly, both `Coroutine` and `RaisingCoroutine` have
  been changed to accept `AnyType` instead of `AnyTrivialRegType`. This means
  the result types of `async` functions do not need to be `Movable`.

  ```mojo
  async fn raise_or_string(c: Bool) raises -> String:
      if c:
          raise "whoops!"
      return "hello world!"
  ```

  Note that `async` functions do not yet support indirect calls, `ref` results,
  and constructors.

- The `Reference` type (and many iterators) now use "inferred" parameters to
  represent the mutability of their lifetime, simplifying the interface.

- Added new `ExplicitlyCopyable` trait, to mark types that can be copied
  explicitly, but which might not be implicitly copyable.

  This supports work to transition the standard library collection types away
  from implicit copyability, which can lead to unintended expensive copies.

- `Dict` now supports `popitem`, which removes and returns the last item in the `Dict`.
([PR #2701](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2701)
by [@jayzhan211](https://github.com/jayzhan211))

- Added `unsafe_cstr_ptr()` method to `String` and `StringLiteral`, that
  returns an `UnsafePointer[C_char]` for convenient interoperability with C
  APIs.

- Added `C_char` type alias in `sys.ffi`.

- Added `TemporaryDirectory` in module `tempfile`.
  ([PR 2743](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2743) by [@artemiogr97](https://github.com/artemiogr97))

- Added temporary `SliceNew` type with corrected behaviour from `Slice` to facilitate
  an incremental internal migration due to reliance on the old, incorrect behaviour.
  ([PR #2894](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2894) by [@bgreni](https://github.com/bgreni))

### 🦋 Changed

- Continued transition to `UnsafePointer` and unsigned byte type for strings:
  - `String.unsafe_ptr()` now returns an `UnsafePointer[UInt8]`
    (was `UnsafePointer[Int8]`)
  - `StringLiteral.unsafe_ptr()` now returns an `UnsafePointer[UInt8]`
    (was `UnsafePointer[Int8]`)

- The global functions for working with `UnsafePointer` have transitioned to
  being methods through the use of conditional conformances:

  - `destroy_pointee(p)` => `p.destroy_pointee()`
  - `move_from_pointee(p)` => `p.take_pointee()`
  - `initialize_pointee_move(p, value)` => `p.init_pointee_move(value)`
  - `initialize_pointee_copy(p, value)` => `p.init_pointee_copy(value)`
  - `move_pointee(src=p1, dst=p2)` => `p.move_pointee_into(p2)`

- `DTypePointer.load/store/prefetch` has been now moved to `SIMD`. Instead of
  using `ptr.load[width=4](offset)` one should use `SIMD[size=4].load(ptr, offset)`.
  Note the default load width before was 1, but the default size of `SIMD` is
  the size of the SIMD type.
  The default store size is the size of the `SIMD` value to be stored.

### ❌ Removed

- Removed `String.unsafe_uint8_ptr()`. `String.unsafe_ptr()` now returns the
  same thing.

- Removed `StringLiteral.unsafe_uint8_ptr()` and `StringLiteral.as_uint8_ptr()`.

- Removed `UnsafePointer.offset(offset:Int)`.

### 🛠️ Fixed

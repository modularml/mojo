### ⭐️ New

- `FileHandle` are now copyable and movable and can be passed by value or add
  them to lists, tuples, etc. This allows for more ergonomic and efficient
  handling of file handles in Mojo. Use `Arc` underneath to share a
  `FileHandle` without having to deal with closed handles usage in copies.

- Mojo can now interpret simple LLVM intrinsics in parameter expressions,
  enabling things like `count_leading_zeros` to work at compile time:
  [Issue #933](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/933).

- The destructor insertion logic in Mojo is now aware that types that take an
  `AnyLifetime` as part of their signature could potentially access any live
  value that destructor insertion is tracking, eliminating a significant
  usability issue with unsafe APIs like `UnsafePointer`.  Consider a typical
  example working with strings before this change:

  ```mojo
  var str = String(...)
  var ptr = str.unsafe_ptr()
  some_low_level_api(ptr)
  _ = str^  # OLD HACK: Explicitly keep string alive until here!
  ```

  The `_ = str^` pattern was formerly required because the Mojo compiler has no
  idea what "ptr" might reference.  As a consequence, it had no idea that
  `some_low_level_api` might access `str` and therefore thought it was ok to
  destroy the `String` before the call - this is why the explicit lifetime
  extension was required.

  Mojo now knows that `UnsafePointer` may access the `AnyLifetime` lifetime,
  and now assumes that any API that uses that lifetime could use live values.
  In this case, it assumes that `some_low_level_api` might access `str` and
  because it might be using it, it cannot destroy `str` until after the call.
  The consequence of this is that the old hack is no longer needed for these
  cases!

- The `UnsafePointer` type now has a `lifetime` parameter that can be used when
  the `UnsafePointer` is known to point into some lifetime.  This lifetime is
  propagated through the `ptr[]` indirection operation.

- The VS Code Mojo Debugger now has a `buildArgs` JSON debug configuration
  setting that can be used in conjunction with `mojoFile` to define the build
  arguments when compiling the Mojo file.

- The VS Code extension now supports a `Configure Build and Run Args` command
  that helps set the build and run args for actions file `Run Mojo File` and
  `Debug Mojo File`. A corresponding button appears in `Run and Debug` selector
  in the top right corner of a Mojo File.

- Add the `Floatable` and `FloatableRaising` traits to denote types that can
  be converted to a `Float64` value using the builtin `float` function.
  - Make `SIMD` and `FloatLiteral` conform to the `Floatable` trait.

  ```mojo
  fn foo[F: Floatable](v: F):
    ...

  var f = float(Int32(45))
  ```

  ([PR #3163](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3163) by [@bgreni](https://github.com/bgreni))

- Add `DLHandle.get_symbol()`, for getting a pointer to a symbol in a dynamic
  library. This is more general purpose than the existing methods for getting
  function pointers.

- Introduce `TypedPythonObject` as a light-weight way to annotate `PythonObject`
  values with static type information. This design will likely evolve and
  change significantly.

  - Added `TypedPythonObject["Tuple].__getitem__` for accessing the elements of
    a Python tuple.

- Added `Python.add_object()`, to add a named `PythonObject` value to a Python
  'module' object instance.

- Added `Python.unsafe_get_python_exception()`, as an efficient low-level
  utility to get the Mojo `Error` equivalent of the current CPython error state.

- The `__type_of(x)` and `__origin_of(x)` operators are much more general now:
  they allow arbitrary expressions inside of them, allow referring to dynamic
  values in parameter contexts, and even allow referring to raising functions
  in non-raising contexts.  These operations never evaluate their expression, so
  any side effects that occur in the expression are never evaluated at runtime,
  eliminating concerns about `__type_of(expensive())` being a problem.

- Add `PythonObject.from_borrowed_ptr()`, to simplify the construction of
  `PythonObject` values from CPython 'borrowed reference' pointers.

  The existing `PythonObject.__init__(PyObjectPtr)` should continue to be used
  for the more common case of constructing a `PythonObject` from a
  'strong reference' pointer.

- The `rebind` standard library function now works with memory-only types in
  addition to `@register_passable("trivial")` ones, without requiring a copy.

- The `Dict.__getitem__` method now returns a reference instead of a copy of
  the value (or raises).  This improves the performance of common code that
  uses `Dict` by allowing borrows from the `Dict` elements.

- Autoparameterization of parameters is now supported. Specifying a parameter
  type with unbound parameters causes them to be implicitly added to the
  function signature as inferred parameters.

  ```mojo
  fn foo[value: SIMD[DType.int32, _]]():
    pass

  # Equivalent to
  fn foo[size: Int, //, value: SIMD[DType.int32, size]]():
    pass
  ```

- Function types now accept a lifetime set parameter. This parameter represents
  the lifetimes of values captured by a parameter closure. The compiler
  automatically tags parameter closures with the right set of lifetimes. This
  enables lifetimes and parameter closures to correctly compose.

  ```mojo
  fn call_it[f: fn() capturing [_] -> None]():
      f()

  fn test():
      var msg = String("hello world")

      @parameter
      fn say_hi():
          print(msg)

      call_it[say_hi]()
      # no longer need to write `_ = msg^`!!
  ```

  Note that this only works for higher-order functions which have explicitly
  added `[_]` as the capture lifetimes. By default, the compiler still assumes
  a `capturing` closure does not reference any lifetimes. This will soon change.

- The VS Code extension now has the `mojo.run.focusOnTerminalAfterLaunch`
  setting, which controls whether to focus on the terminal used by the
  `Mojo: Run Mojo File` command or on the editor after launch.
  [Issue #3532](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/3532).

- The VS Code extension now has the `mojo.SDK.additionalSDKs` setting, which
  allows the user to provide a list of MAX SDKs that the extension can use when
  determining a default SDK to use. The user can select the default SDK to use
  with the `Mojo: Select the default MAX SDK` command.

- Added a new [`Box`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/box/Box) type as a safe, single-owner,
  non-nullable smart pointer with similar semantics to Rust's
  [`Box<>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) and C++'s
  [`std::unique_ptr`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr).

  ([PR #3524](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3524) by [@szbergeron](https://github.com/szbergeron))

- `ref` argument and result specifiers now allow providing a memory value
  directly in the lifetime specifier, rather than requiring the use of
  `__origin_of`.  It is still fine to use `__origin_of` explicitly though,
  and this is required when specifying lifetimes for parameters (e.g. to the
  `Reference` type). For example, this is now valid without `__origin_of`:

  ```mojo
  fn return_ref(a: String) -> ref [a] String:
      return a
  ```

- `Slice.step` is now an `Optional[Int]`, matching the optionality of
  `slice.step` in Python.
  ([PR #3160](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3160) by
   [@bgreni](https://github.com/bgreni))

- `StringRef` now implements `split()` which can be used to split a
  `StringRef` into a `List[StringRef]` by a delimiter.
  ([PR #2705](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/2705) by [@fknfilewalker](https://github.com/fknfilewalker))

- Support for multi-dimensional indexing for `PythonObject`
  ([PR #3583](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3583) by [@jjvraw](https://github.com/jjvraw)).

- Support for multi-dimensional indexing and slicing for `PythonObject`
  (PRs  [#3549](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3549),
  [#3583](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3583) by [@jjvraw](https://github.com/jjvraw)).

    ```mojo
    var np = Python.import_module("numpy")
    var a = np.array(PythonObject([1,2,3,4,5,6])).reshape(2,3)
    print((a[0, 1])) # 2
    print((a[1][::-1])) # [6 5 4]
   ```

  Note, that the syntax, `a[1, ::-1]`, is currently not supported.

- [`Arc`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/arc/Arc) now implements
  [`Identifiable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/identifiable/Identifiable), and can be
  compared for pointer equivalence using `a is b`.

- There is now a [`Byte`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/simd/Byte) alias to better
  express intent when working with a pack of bits.
  ([PR #3670](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/pull/3670) by [@soraos](https://github.com/soraros)).

### 🦋 Changed

- More things have been removed from the auto-exported set of entities in the `prelude`
  module from the Mojo standard library.
  - `UnsafePointer` has been removed. Please explicitly import it via
    `from memory import UnsafePointer`.
  - `StringRef` has been removed. Please explicitly import it via
    `from utils import StringRef`.

- The `Reference` type has been renamed to `Pointer`: a memory safe complement
  to `UnsafePointer`.  This change is motivated by the fact that `Pointer`
  is assignable and requires an explicit dereference with `ptr[]`.  Renaming
  to `Pointer` clarifies that "references" means `ref` arguments and results,
  and gives us a model that is more similar to what the C++ community would
  expect.

- A new `as_noalias_ptr` method as been added to `UnsafePointer`. This method
  specifies to the compiler that the resultant pointer is a distinct
  identifiable object that does not alias any other memory in the local scope.

- The `AnyLifetime` type (useful for declaring lifetime types as parameters) has
  been renamed to `Lifetime`.

- Restore implicit copyability of `Tuple` and `ListLiteral`.

- The aliases for C FFI have been renamed: `C_int` -> `c_int`, `C_long` -> `c_long`
  and so on.

- The VS Code extension now allows selecting a default SDK when multiple are available.

- The flag for turning on asserts has changed, e.g. to enable all checks:

  ```bash
  mojo -D ASSERT=all main.mojo
  ```

  The levels are:

  - none: all assertions off
  - warn: print assertion errors e.g. for multithreaded tests (previously -D
    ASSERT_WARNING)
  - safe: the default mode for standard CPU safety assertions
  - all: turn on all assertions (previously -D MOJO_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS)

  You can now also pass `Stringable` args to format a message, which will have
  no runtime penalty or IR bloat cost when assertions are off. Previously you
  had to:

  ```mojo
  x = -1
  debug_assert(
    x > 0, String.format_sequence(“expected x to be more than 0 but got: ”, x)
  )
  ```

  Which can't be optimized away by the compiler in release builds, you can now
  pass multiple args for a formatted message at no runtime cost:

  ```mojo
  debug_assert(x > 0, “expected x to be more than 0 but got: ”, x)
  ```

- The `StaticIntTuple` datastructure in the `utils` package has been renamed to
  `IndexList`. The datastructure now allows one to specify the index bitwidth of
  the elements along with whether the underlying indices are signed or unsigned.

- A new trait has been added `AsBytes` to enable taking a `Span[UInt8]` of a
  type with `s.as_bytes()`. `String.as_bytes` and `String.as_bytes_slice` have
  been consolidated under `s.as_bytes` to return a `Span[UInt8]`, you can convert
  it to a `List` if you require a copy with `List(s.as_bytes())`.

- `Lifetime` and related types has been renamed to `Origin` in the standard
  library to better clarify that parameters of this type indicate where a
  reference is derived from, not the more complicated notion of where a variable
  is initialized and destroyed.  Please see [the proposal](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/main/proposals/lifetimes-keyword-renaming.md)
  for more information and rationale.  As a consequence `__lifetime_of` is now
  named `__origin_of`.

### ❌ Removed

### 🛠️ Fixed

- Lifetime tracking is now fully field sensitive, which makes the uninitialized
  variable checker more precise.

- [Issue #3444](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/3444) - Raising init
  causing use of uninitialized variable

- [Issue #3544](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/3544) - Known
  mutable `ref` argument are not optimized as `noalias` by LLVM.

- [Issue #3559](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/3559) - VariadicPack
  doesn't extend the lifetimes of the values it references.

- [Issue #3627](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/3627) - Compiler
  overlooked exclusivity violation caused by `ref [MutableAnyLifetime] T`

- The VS Code extension now auto-updates its private copy of the MAX SDK.

- The variadic initializer for `SIMD` now works in parameter expressions.

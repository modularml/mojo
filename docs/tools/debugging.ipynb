    "## Tips and tricks\n",
    "\n",
    " There are several features in the standard library that aren't directly related\n",
    " to the debugger, but which can help you debug your programs. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Programmatic breakpoints.\n",
    " * Setting parameters from the Mojo command line.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Set a programmatic breakpoint\n",
    "\n",
    " To break at a specific point in your code, you can use the built-in\n",
    " [`breakpoint()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/breakpoint/breakpoint) function:\n",
    "\n",
    " ```mojo\n",
    "if some_value.is_valid():\n",
    "    do_the_right_thing()\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # We should never get here!\n",
    "    breakpoint()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have VS Code open and run this code in debug mode (either using VS Code\n",
    "or `mojo debug`), hitting the `breakpoint()` call causes an error, which\n",
    "triggers the debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::note Assertions\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`testing`](/mojo/stdlib/testing/testing/) module includes a number of \n",
    "ways to specify assertions. Assertions also trigger an error, so can open the \n",
    "debugger in the same way that a `breakpoint()` call will.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set parameters from the Mojo command line\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the [`param_env`](/mojo/stdlib/sys/param_env/) module to retrieve\n",
    "parameter values specified on the Mojo command line. Among other things, this\n",
    "is an easy way to switch debugging logic on and off. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mojo\n",
    "from param_env import is_defined\n",
    "\n",
    "def some_function_with_issues():\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    @parameter\n",
    "    if is_defined[\"DEBUG_ME\"]():\n",
    "        breakpoint()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate this code, use the [`-D` command-line\n",
    "option](/mojo/cli/debug#compilation-options) to define `DEBUG_ME`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mojo debug -D DEBUG_ME main.mojo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `is_defined()` function returns a compile-time true or false value based on\n",
    "whether the specified name is defined. Since the `breakpoint()` call is inside a\n",
    "[parametric `if` statement](/mojo/manual/decorators/parameter#parametric-if-statement),\n",
    "it is only included in the compiled code when the `DEBUG_ME` name is defined on\n",
    "the command line."

    "If using `mojo debug --rpc` gives you the message `error: can't connect to the RPC debug server socket: Connection refused`, try the following possible fixes:\n",

    " * If VS Code is already open, try restarting VS Code.\n",
    " * If there are other VS Code windows open, try closing them and then restarting. This error can sometimes occur when multiple windows have opened and closed in certain orders.\n",

    "\n",
    "If using `mojo debug --rpc` gives you the message `error: couldn't get a valid response from the RPC server`, try the following possible fixes:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Make sure VS Code is open to a valid Mojo codebase. This error can sometimes happen if the VS Code window is open to some other codebase.\n",
    " * If there are multiple VS Code windows open, try closing all but the one you wish to debug in.\n",
    " * Restart VS Code.\n",
    " * Reinstall the SDK and restart VSCode.\n",
    " * If you are working on a development version of the SDK, make sure that all SDK tools are properly built with your build system, and then reload VSCode.\n",
    " * As a last resort, restarting your entire computer can fix this problem.\n",

trait Movable:
    """The Movable trait denotes a type whose value can be moved.

    Implement the `Movable` trait on `Foo` which requires the `__moveinit__`
    method:

    ```mojo

        fn __init__(inout self):
            pass

        fn __moveinit__(inout self, owned existing: Self):
            print("moving")
    ```

    You can now use the ^ suffix to move the object instead of copying
    it inside generic functions:

    ```mojo
    fn return_foo[T: Movable](owned foo: T) -> T:
        return foo^

    var foo = Foo()
    var res = return_foo(foo^)

trait ExplicitlyCopyable:
    """The ExplicitlyCopyable trait denotes a type whose value can be copied
    explicitly.

    Unlike `Copyable`, which denotes types that are _implicitly_ copyable, an
    explicitly copyable type can only be copied when the explicit copy
    initializer is called intentionally by the programmer.

    An explicit copy initializer is just a normal `__init__` method that takes
    a `borrowed` argument of `Self`.

    Example implementing the `ExplicitlyCopyable` trait on `Foo` which requires
    the `__init__(.., Self)` method:

    ```mojo
    struct Foo(ExplicitlyCopyable):
        var s: String

            self.s = s

            print("explicitly copying value")
            self.s = copy.s
    ```

    You can now copy objects inside a generic function:

    ```mojo
    fn copy_return[T: ExplicitlyCopyable](foo: T) -> T:
        var copy = T(foo)
        return copy

    var foo = Foo("test")

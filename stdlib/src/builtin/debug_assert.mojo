    """Asserts that the condition is true.

    Parameters:
        cond: The function to invoke to check if the assertion holds.
        assert_mode: Determines when the assert is turned on.
        cpu_only: If true, only run the assert on CPU.
        Ts: The element types conforming to `Writable` for the message.

    Args:
        messages: Arguments to convert to a `String` message.


    You can pass in multiple args that are `Writable` to generate a formatted
    message, by default this will be a no-op:

    ```mojo
    x = 0
    debug_assert(x > 0, "expected x to be more than 0 but got: ", x)
    ```

    You can change the assertion level for example:

    ```sh
    mojo -D ASSERT=all main.mojo
    ```

    Assertion modes:

    - none: turn off all assertions for performance at the cost of safety.
    - warn: print any errors instead of aborting.
    - safe: standard safety checks that are on even in release builds.
    - all: turn on all assertions.

    You can set the `assert_mode` to `safe` so the assertion runs even in
    release builds:

    ```mojo
    debug_assert[assert_mode="safe"](
        x > 0, "expected x to be more than 0 but got: ", x
    )
    ```

    To ensure that you have no runtime penality from your assertion in release
    builds, make sure there are no side effects in your message and condition.
    Take this example:

    ```mojo
    person = "name: john, age: 50"
    name = "john"
    debug_assert(str("name: ") + name == person, "unexpected name")
    ```

    This will have a runtime penality due to allocating a `String` in the
    condition even in release builds, you must put the condition inside a
    closure so it only runs when the assertion is turned on:

    ```mojo
    fn check_name() capturing -> Bool:
        return str("name: ") + name == person

    debug_assert[check_name]("unexpected name")
    ```

    If you need to allocate, and so don't want the assert to ever run on GPU,
    you can set it to CPU only:

    ```mojo
    debug_assert[check_name, cpu_only=True]("unexpected name")
    ```

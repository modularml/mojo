    Parameters:
        assert_mode: Determines when the assert is turned on.
        cpu_only: If true, only run the assert on CPU.

    Args:
        cond: The function to invoke to check if the assertion holds.
        message: A StringLiteral to print on failure.


    Pass in a condition and single StringLiteral to stop execution and
    show an error on failure:

    ```mojo
    x = 0
    debug_assert(x > 0, "x is not more than 0")
    ```

    By default it's a no-op, you can change the assertion level for example:

    ```sh
    mojo -D ASSERT=all main.mojo
    ```

    Assertion modes:

    - none: turn off all assertions for performance at the cost of safety.
    - warn: print any errors instead of aborting.
    - safe: standard safety checks that are on even in release builds.
    - all: turn on all assertions.

    You can set the `assert_mode` to `safe` so the assertion runs even in
    release builds:

    ```mojo
    debug_assert[assert_mode="safe"](
        x > 0, "expected x to be more than 0 but got: ", x
    )
    ```

    To ensure that you have no runtime penality from your assertion in release
    builds, make sure there are no side effects in your message and condition.

    On GPU this will also show the the block and thread idx's on failure.

"""Reference-counted smart pointers.

Example usage:

```mojo
from memory import Arc
var p = Arc(4)
var p2 = p
p2[]=3
print(3 == p[])
```

Subscripting(`[]`) is done by `Reference`,
in order to ensure that the underlying `Arc` outlive the operation.

It is highly DISCOURAGED to manipulate an `Arc` through `UnsafePointer`.
Mojo's ASAP deletion policy ensure values are destroyed at last use.
Do not unsafely dereference the `Arc` inner `UnsafePointer` field.
See [Lifecycle](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/lifecycle/).

```mojo
# Illustration of what NOT to do, in order to understand:
print(Arc(String("ok"))._inner[].payload)
#........................^ASAP ^already freed
```

Always use `Reference` subscripting (`[]`):

```mojo
print(Arc(String("ok"))[])
```

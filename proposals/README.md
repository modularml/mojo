# Mojo🔥 engineering design proposals

This directory contains ad-hoc design proposals put together by the Mojo
engineering team. These are meant to help shape discussion and refine the
design of various subsystems, but typically become obsolete and incorporated into
more canonical documentation when the implementation work concludes. There is
no attempt to keep these up-to-date as the language evolves, so they are
more for historical reference than as a user-guide for the language.
